    "In this notebook, we will go through a comprehensive Python boot camp focused on foundational computer vision concepts. You will learn about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Preparing and understanding image data**: How to programmatically download a dataset, inspect image properties like shape and data type, and preprocess them using `tifffile` and `numpy`.\n",
    "* **Data augmentation**: Implementing common image transformations such as flipping and rotation using both basic Python libraries like `numpy` and deep-learning frameworks like PyTorch's `torchvision`.\n",
    "* **Convolutions**: Understanding and implementing 2D convolutions, the foundational operation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and seeing how different filters can extract specific features from an image.\n",
    "* **Efficient data loading**: Creating batches of data and building an efficient data loading pipeline using PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes.\n",
    "* **Advanced image analysis**: Using libraries like `scikit-image` and `matplotlib` to perform analyses, such as visualizing cell size distributions and overlaying segmentation masks on original images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using sample images from the *MoNuSeg* dataset provided by [Kumar et al, 2018](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8880654). The data was publicly made available [here](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/) by the authors of the publication. This dataset shows Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Stained Images showing nuclei in different shapes."
