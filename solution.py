# # Python Boot Camp
#
#
# Welcome! 😃👋
#
# In this notebook, we will go through some basic image processing in Python, come across standard tasks required while setting up deep learning pipelines, and familiarize ourselves with popular packages such as `glob`, `tifffile`, `tqdm` and more.
# We will learn about:
# - Loading images (This is important as images are the primary input to most deep learning models)
# - Normalizing images (This is important as it helps in faster convergence of models becuse it helps in reducing the scale of the input data and hence the scale of the gradients)
# - Cropping images (This is important as it helps in creating smaller images from the original images which is useful for training models in a memory efficient way)
# - Downsampling images (This is important as it helps in reducing the size of the images which is useful for training models in a memory efficient way)
# - Flipping images (This is important as it helps in creating new images from the original data which is useful for training models in a memory efficient way)
# - Batching images (As we train in a SGD manner, batching is important as it helps in training the model in a memory efficient way and smoothens the optimization process)
# - Convolutions (This is important as it is the primary operation in Convolutional Neural Networks)
# - Data Augmentation (This is important as it helps in artificially increasing the size of the training data which is useful for training models in a data efficient way)

#
# We will be using sample images from the *MoNuSeg* dataset provided by [Kumar et al, 2018](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8880654). The data was publicly made available [here](https://monuseg.grand-challenge.org/) by the authors of the publication.
#
# This dataset shows Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Stained Images showing nuclei in different shapes.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Chapter 0: Downloading data from an external url

# %% [markdown]
# Let us first download the images from an external url.
# To do so, we need to import some commonly used dependencies.

# %%
from pathlib import Path # this library is used to handle file paths 
import urllib.request, zipfile # urllib is used to download files from the internet, zipfile is used to extract zip files

# %% [markdown]
# Here, below is a helper function to download the data from an external url specified by argument `zip_url` and save it to a local directory specified by argument `project_name`. Let's execute the function (No output expected yet!).


# %%
def extract_data(zip_url, project_name):
    zip_path = Path(project_name + ".zip")
    if zip_path.exists():
        print("Zip file was downloaded and extracted before!")
    else:
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(zip_url, zip_path)
        print("Downloaded data as {}".format(zip_path))
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, "r") as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall("./")
    print("Unzipped data to {}".format(Path(project_name)))


# %% [markdown]
# Now we call the function `extract_data` specifying desirable values of the arguments.

# %%
extract_data(
    zip_url="https://owncloud.mpi-cbg.de/index.php/s/xwYonC9LucjLsY6/download",
    project_name="monuseg-2018",

# ### Task 0.1
# Click on the `Files` directory (left panel) and check if some images exist within the `monuseg-2018` directory.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Task 0.2
# Can you use a bash command to programmatically count the number of images and masks present in the `download/images` directory ?
#
# *Hint*: Use `!ls -l <path> | wc - l` (you can run any bash command in a jupyter notebook by prefixing it with `!`) [Read more on this [here](https://linuxstans.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bash-cheat-sheet.png)]

#
# 2D Images are often represented as numpy arrays of shape (`height`, `width`, `num_channels`).

# Multiple utilities/packages exist to read images from files in Python.

#
# If you look in the directory (`monuseg-2018/download`), you can see directories called `images` and `masks`.
#
# Let's load one image and visualize it using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`. <br>
# `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow` is the standard way to show images in jupyter notebooks!

#

# Sometimes, the a neural network expects the input to be in a certain format, and we need to reshape the data accordingly. <br>
# Lets add a batch dimension (batching will be introduced later) to the image. <br>
# We can use `np.newaxis` to add a new axis to the image for this case as we are dealing with numpy arrays.
# Later we will see how to do this in PyTorch using `torch.unsqueeze`.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Normalizing Images
#
# Providing image inputs with intensities between [0, 1] often helps when training the model. <br>
# This is because the gradients are more stable and the model converges faster, and the model is not biased towards any particular intensity values. <br>

# For example, let's extract the top left (second) quadrant from one of our images.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Downsampling
#
# For large images, sometimes we require that they are downsampled to fit in memory. <br>
#
# **Note:** Downsampling is a lossy operation, as we are removing information from the image. If your images contain important information in the removed pixels, this can be detrimental to the model's performance. <br>
# This is usually not a problem for images with a high resolution, as the removed information is often redundant. <br>
# However, if subtle structes in the content of your image is important, it is better to crop the image rather than downsample it. <br>
#
# Say if one wants to have every fourth pixel from the original image, one specifies `factor` = $4$, and one can run the following cell:

# %%
# downsampling
idx = np.random.randint(len(img_filenames))
img = imread(img_filenames[idx])

factor = 4

# %% [markdown]
# ## Chapter 3
# ### Batching
#
# In ML/DL, we often have to deal with very large datasets. It soon becomes inefficient to process all the data at once, so it's useful to split the data into "mini-batches" that we can process individually.
#
# So for purely reasons of computational cost, this is often useful.
#
# We will also see another reason for which batching can be useful - for instance when running gradient descent on non-convex landscapes.
# Here, computing the gradient on a subset of the data gives us an approximate/noisy gradient making it less likely for us to end up being stuck in local minima. This is what is referred to as "stochastic gradient descent".
#
# Let us make our first batch of images, containing $B$ number of images.
# The shape of the batch will thus get an additional "batch dimension" at the first dimension, i.e. (batch_size, num_channels, height, width).

### Task 3.1

Make a batch of size $B=4$ by sampling 4 images randomly from the available images (this will be a 4D np array).

**Hint**: Use `np.random.choice` to sample 4 random indices from the list of image filenames. 
`np.random.randint` (which we have used above) to select batches could give duplicate images in a batch. In this case, your batch should contain 4 unique images.

#
# Convolutions are the elementary operations used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). <br> The images (and later, the feature maps) are convolved with multiple filters whose weights are learned. <br>

# ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/2D_Convolution_Animation.gif)

### Task 3.2
Implement a function that performs a convolution of an image with a filter.
<br> Assume that your image is square and that your filter is square and has an odd width. You can set arbitrary values in your filter for now.
<br> Note that your output image will be smaller.

**A few things to note:** <br>
-- Filter: A filter is a matrix that is convolved with the image. The filter is also known as a kernel. It computes the correlation between the itself and the image. It is kind of finding the similarity between the filter and the image.
The filter is applied to the image by sliding the filter over the image and computing the dot product between the filter and the image at each location. The output of the convolution is called the feature map (a concept that will come up in future exercises).

-- The filter is usually a square matrix with odd dimensions. This is because the filter is applied to the image by sliding it over the image. If the filter has even dimensions, it will not have a center pixel. This will make it difficult to align the filter with the image. 
If the filter is not square, we loose the symmetrical applicability of the filter. The filter then will have to be applied in different directions (height, width) separately. This will make the implementation more complex and migt lead to distortions in the output features.

# - Given an input image of size $H \times W$, a filter of size $K_h \times K_w$ , and strides $S_h$ and $S_w$
# the output size (height $H_{out}$ and width $W_{out}$) can be calculated using the following formulas (Note that $\lfloor.\rfloor$ is the floor operator):

# $$
# \begin{equation*}
#     H_{out} = \left\lfloor \frac{H - K_h}{S_h} \right\rfloor + 1

# \begin{equation*}
#     W_{out} = \left\lfloor \frac{W - K_w}{S_w} \right\rfloor + 1

# ## Chapter 4: Data augmentation
#
# Having collected your hard earned data you want to make the most of it. In ML/DL, we're often limited by the size of our the training set. 
# How could we artificially increase our data to provide more input to our model and help it generalize better?
#
# One trick is to make simple transformations to our data such as rotating or flipping it - this process is generally called "data augmentation" (DA) and is widely used in ML.
#
# Here we will implement some basic data augmentation techniques using numpy. 

# **Note:** This is a good opportunity to learn how this augmentations work under the hood. 
# However in practice, we would use libraries like `torchvision` or `monai` which are optimized for speed and have a wide range of augmentations available.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Applying one augmentation at a time
# Lets apply one augmentation to the image at a time.
# **Note:** With advanced libraries like `torchvision` or `monai`, you can apply multiple augmentations at once. [Read more about [Torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html) and [Monai](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/transforms.html)]

# ## Chapter 5: (Optional) Advanced Plotting and Visualization

# Python's matplotlib is a powerful library for creating visualizations.
# It is also highly customizable and can be used to create complex plots.
# In deep learning, visualizing the data is important as it helps in understanding the data and the model better.
# Therefore, it is important to know how to create different types of plots using matplotlib with specific (useful) functions.

# ### Colormap
# You can choose a specific colormap to visualize your images.
# Read more about colormaps [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html)
# %%
plt.imshow(img[..., 0], cmap="magma")  #Note that we are only showing the first channel of the image
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()

# %% [markdown]

# ### Colorbar
# Sometimes, you may want to add a colorbar to your image to show the intensity values.
#
# **Note**: The <code>vmin</code> and <code>vmax</code> arguments are used to set the range of the colorbar.
# In this case, the intensity values range from 0 to 255. But you can set the range to any values you want (based on the intensity values in the image). <br>
# **Note**: for plotting colorbar for instance mask (in the future), you can use <code>viridis</code> colormap for the mask for better visualization.
# %%

plt.imshow(img[..., 0], cmap="magma", vmin=0, vmax=255)
plt.colorbar()
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
# %% [markdown]

# ### Plotting Histograms
# - Let's see the histogram of the intensity values
# - <code>img</code> is an 8-bit image, so the intensity values range from 0 to 255

# %%
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
# bins indicate how may unique buclets you might want to put your values in and range is the min and max values in the image
# Try different values for bins and range to see how the histogram changes
plt.hist(img[..., 0].ravel(), bins=255, range=(0.0, img[..., 0].max()))
plt.xlabel("Intensity Value")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()

# Often we might need to plot multiple images side by side.
# Let's plot the crop of the original image from different locations side by side.
